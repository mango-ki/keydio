# Keydio
A fun Windows app that plays audio files when you press certain keys and common key combos, which definitely does not get annoying the more you use it! 

Written in Rust. because crustaceans are cool.
# Usage
Keydio plays a unique sound for each of the following keys/combos:
- **Enter** (*enter.mp3*)
- **Backspace** (*back.mp3*)
- **Space** (*space.mp3*)
- **Print Screen** (*prntscrn.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+S** (*save.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+Z** (*undo.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+C** (*copy.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+V** (*paste.mp3*)
- **Alt+F4** (*close.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+Alt+Del** (*panic.mp3*)
- **Ctrl+Shift+Esc** (*taskman.mp3*)

To change the sounds for each key, simply replace the audio for the key you want with a new one, and give it the same filename as the last one.

To remove a sound for a key or combo, simply delete its audio file. You can place it back later if you want to.

To exit Keydio, press **Ctrl+Alt+Q**. You can even change the sound that plays as it exits (*exit.mp3*)!

**Note:** Sounds must not be any longer than 4 seconds.
